    {
      question: "What is the minimum down payment required for a home loan?",
      answer: "Banks typically require a minimum down payment of 10-20% of the property value. For properties valued up to ₹30 lakhs, you can get up to 90% financing (10% down payment). For properties above ₹30 lakhs, banks usually finance up to 75-80% (20-25% down payment). A higher down payment reduces your loan amount and EMI burden."
    },
    {
      question: "How does loan tenure affect my EMI and total interest?",
      answer: "Longer tenure reduces monthly EMI but increases total interest paid over the loan period. For example, a ₹50 lakh loan at 8% for 15 years has EMI of ₹47,782 with total interest of ₹36 lakh. The same loan for 30 years has EMI of ₹36,687 but total interest of ₹82 lakh. Choose tenure based on your repayment capacity and financial goals."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of prepaying home loan?",
      answer: "Prepaying your home loan reduces the outstanding principal, which significantly lowers total interest paid and can shorten loan tenure. Most banks allow partial prepayment without penalty for floating rate loans. Even small annual prepayments can save lakhs in interest. For example, prepaying ₹1 lakh annually on a ₹50 lakh loan can save over ₹15 lakhs in interest."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I choose fixed or floating interest rate?",
      answer: "Floating rates are linked to repo rate and change with market conditions, while fixed rates remain constant. Floating rates are typically 1-2.5% lower than fixed rates and beneficial in falling rate scenarios. Fixed rates provide EMI stability and are suitable if you expect rates to rise. Most borrowers opt for floating rates due to lower interest costs over the long term."
    },
    {
      question: "What tax benefits are available on home loans?",
      answer: "Under Section 24(b), you can claim deduction up to ₹2 lakhs on home loan interest for self-occupied property. Under Section 80C, principal repayment up to ₹1.5 lakhs is deductible. First-time home buyers get additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80EE. For under-construction property, you can claim accumulated interest after possession. These deductions are available only in old tax regime."

                A home loan (housing loan) is a secured loan provided by banks and financial institutions to help you purchase residential 
                property. The property itself serves as collateral, which is why home loans have lower interest rates compared to personal 
                loans. In India, banks typically finance 75-90% of the property value, requiring you to make a down payment for the remaining amount.
              </p>
              
              <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Types of Home Loans in India:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Home Purchase Loan:</strong> For buying ready-to-move-in residential property</li>
                <li><strong>Home Construction Loan:</strong> For constructing a house on owned land</li>
                <li><strong>Home Improvement Loan:</strong> For renovating or repairing existing property</li>
                <li><strong>Plot Loan:</strong> For purchasing residential land (higher interest rates)</li>
                <li><strong>Balance Transfer:</strong> Refinancing existing home loan at lower interest rate</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Home Loan Eligibility:</strong> Banks assess your eligibility based on age (21-65 years), income (minimum ₹25,000/month), 
                credit score (above 750 preferred), existing liabilities, and employment stability. Your EMI should not exceed 40-50% of your 
                monthly income. Self-employed individuals need to show 2-3 years of income tax returns and business stability.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Prepayment Benefits:</strong> Making partial prepayments significantly reduces your interest burden. Most banks allow 
                prepayment without penalty for floating rate loans. Even prepaying ₹50,000-₹1 lakh annually can save lakhs in interest and 
                reduce tenure by several years. Always prepay early in the loan tenure for maximum savings, as initial years have higher interest component.
