      question: "What is a healthy BMI range for adults?",
      answer: "A healthy BMI for adults is typically between 18.5 and 24.9 according to WHO standards. This range is associated with the lowest health risks and optimal wellness outcomes. Maintaining BMI in this range helps reduce risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and certain cancers. BMI below 18.5 is underweight (may indicate malnutrition), 25-29.9 is overweight (increased health risks), and 30+ is obese (high risk of serious health conditions)."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is BMI for measuring body fat and health?",
      answer: "BMI is a reliable screening tool for the general population and correlates well with body fat percentage in most people. Our calculator uses the standard WHO formula (weight/heightÂ²) and is highly accurate for calculations. However, BMI has limitations - it doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat mass, so athletes and bodybuilders may be classified as overweight despite low body fat. It also doesn't measure fat distribution (belly fat vs subcutaneous fat). For comprehensive assessment, consider additional metrics like waist circumference, body fat percentage, and overall fitness."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this BMI calculator for children and teenagers?",
      answer: "This calculator is designed specifically for adults aged 18 and above. Children and teenagers (2-19 years) have different BMI standards because they're still growing and their body composition changes with age. For children, doctors use BMI-for-age percentile charts that account for age and gender. A child's BMI is compared to others of the same age/sex. Consult pediatric growth charts or your pediatrician for accurate BMI assessment for children. Never use adult BMI categories for kids."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if my BMI indicates overweight or obesity?",
      answer: "If your BMI is 25 or above, consider consulting a healthcare provider for personalized advice. They can assess your overall health, body composition, waist circumference, and other risk factors. Don't panic - BMI is just one indicator. Recommended steps: (1) Get medical evaluation including blood tests, (2) Create a sustainable diet plan with calorie deficit, (3) Increase physical activity gradually (150+ minutes weekly), (4) Set realistic goals (0.5-1 kg weight loss per week), (5) Monitor progress regularly. Even 5-10% weight loss can significantly improve health markers."
    },
    {
      question: "Are BMI ranges different for different ethnicities and populations?",
      answer: "Yes, BMI cutoff points can vary for different ethnic groups due to differences in body composition and fat distribution. For Asian populations, WHO recommends lower cutoffs: overweight starts at BMI 23 (instead of 25) and obese at 27.5 (instead of 30) because Asians tend to have higher body fat percentage and more visceral fat at lower BMI levels. Pacific Islanders may have higher muscle mass, affecting interpretation. Always consult healthcare providers familiar with ethnicity-specific guidelines. Some countries have adopted population-specific BMI categories for more accurate health risk assessment."

          <p>
            Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely-used screening tool that measures body fat based on your height and weight. 
            Developed by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in the 1830s, BMI provides a reliable indicator of body 
            fatness for most people and is used globally to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems. 
            The World Health Organization (WHO) and healthcare systems worldwide use BMI as a standard metric to assess 
            weight status and associated health risks.

              <p className="text-sm mt-2">For imperial units: BMI = (weight in pounds Ã 703) / (height in inches)Â²</p>

                <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI 25 to 29.9 - Increased risk of health problems</li>
                <li><strong>Obese Class I:</strong> BMI 30 to 34.9 - High risk of health complications</li>
                <li><strong>Obese Class II:</strong> BMI 35 to 39.9 - Very high risk</li>

            <strong>Health Implications:</strong> BMI correlates with health risks. Higher BMI (above 25) increases risk of 
            cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, osteoarthritis, certain cancers, and sleep apnea. 
            Lower BMI (below 18.5) may indicate malnutrition, weakened immune system, osteoporosis, and anemia. Maintaining 
            BMI in the normal range (18.5-24.9) is associated with optimal health outcomes and longevity.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>BMI Limitations:</strong> While BMI is useful for general population screening, it has limitations. It doesn't 
            distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass, so muscular athletes may be classified as overweight despite low body fat. 
            It doesn't account for fat distribution (visceral vs subcutaneous fat), bone density, age, sex, or ethnicity differences. 
            For athletes, elderly, pregnant women, and growing children, BMI should be interpreted with caution alongside other health 
            metrics like waist circumference, body fat percentage, and overall fitness level.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Ethnicity Considerations:</strong> BMI cutoffs may vary for different ethnic groups. Asian populations, for example, 
            may experience increased health risks at lower BMI levels (overweight starts at BMI 23, obese at 27.5 according to some 
            Asian-specific guidelines). This is because different populations have different body compositions and fat distribution 
            patterns at the same BMI level. Consult healthcare providers familiar with ethnicity-specific guidelines for accurate assessment.
