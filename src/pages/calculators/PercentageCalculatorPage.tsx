    {
      question: "How do I calculate percentage of a number?",
      answer: "To find percentage of a number, use the formula: (Percentage ÷ 100) × Total = Result. For example, to find 20% of 500: (20 ÷ 100) × 500 = 100. Our calculator does this instantly - just enter the percentage and the total value."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I calculate percentage increase or decrease?",
      answer: "Percentage change formula is: ((New Value - Old Value) ÷ Old Value) × 100. For increase, the result is positive; for decrease, it's negative. Example: if a price increased from ₹100 to ₹120, the percentage increase is ((120-100) ÷ 100) × 100 = 20%."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between percentage and percentile?",
      answer: "Percentage is a fraction out of 100 representing a portion of a whole (like 75% marks). Percentile is a statistical measure indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations fall (like scoring in the 90th percentile means you scored better than 90% of test-takers)."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I calculate discount percentage?",
      answer: "Discount percentage = ((Original Price - Sale Price) ÷ Original Price) × 100. For example, if an item originally costs ₹1,000 and is now ₹750, the discount is ((1000-750) ÷ 1000) × 100 = 25% off."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use percentage calculator for tax calculations?",
      answer: "Yes! Percentage calculators are perfect for tax calculations. To add tax, calculate the tax percentage of the base amount and add it. To find the base amount before tax, use reverse percentage calculations. For example, adding 18% GST to ₹1,000: (18 ÷ 100) × 1000 = ₹180 tax."

                A percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. The word "percent" literally means "per 
                hundred." Here are the most common percentage formulas:

                <div>
                  <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">1. Percentage of a Number:</p>
                  <p className="font-mono">(Percentage ÷ 100) × Total = Result</p>
                  <p className="text-sm">Example: 15% of 200 = (15 ÷ 100) × 200 = 30</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>

                  <p className="font-mono">(Part ÷ Total) × 100 = Percentage</p>
                  <p className="text-sm">Example: 45 is what % of 180? = (45 ÷ 180) × 100 = 25%</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                  <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">3. Percentage Change:</p>
                  <p className="font-mono">((New - Old) ÷ Old) × 100 = % Change</p>
                  <p className="text-sm">Example: From 80 to 100 = ((100 - 80) ÷ 80) × 100 = 25% increase</p>

              <p>
                These formulas are used constantly in real life. When shopping, you use percentage to calculate discounts 
                and final prices. In finance, percentage helps compute interest rates, returns on investment, and profit 
                margins. Students use percentages to understand grades and scoring. Business professionals analyze growth 
                rates, market shares, and performance metrics - all expressed as percentages.
